== Scrappy.be

A bookmarking tool to help groups of people collaborate, comment and share useful links within a particular domain. I built this because everyone in our class was sending around links, and we couldn't find a simple platform for managing all of this content. Other bookmarking tools are focused on pinning inspirational images, or saving content to your own profile, whereas Scrappy.be is about finding groups of individuals which share a similar interest to you, and then collaborating and sharing knowledge.
